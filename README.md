# Dedicated Server Project

The code contained in this repo mostly comes from the online course ["2024 Multiplayer Mastery â€“ (RPG)" by Jason Weimann](https://game.courses/courses/multiplayer-mastery-2024/). This project serves as an 
example of how to create a multiplayer game in Unity and host it on a dedicated server. The code comments are my own and represent my thoughts and opinions throughout the course. After the conclusion of the course,
I may continue to work on this project to make it more mine (note the various "TODO" comments).
